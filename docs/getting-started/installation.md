# Installation

## Linux

::: warning Requires systemd
Lerd runs every container as a Podman Quadlet and every worker as a systemd user service, so a systemd-based distro is required. OpenRC (Gentoo, Artix-openrc, Alpine), runit (Void, Artix-runit), s6, and sysvinit-based distros (Devuan) are not supported.

Tested and known-good: Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Debian, Mint, Pop!_OS, openSUSE, CachyOS, Omarchy. Any systemd distro should work.
:::

### One-line installer (recommended)

::: code-group

```bash [curl]
curl -fsSL https://lerd.sh/install.sh | bash
```

```bash [wget]
wget -qO- https://lerd.sh/install.sh | bash
```

```bash [From source]
git clone https://github.com/geodro/lerd
cd lerd
make build
make install            # installs to ~/.local/bin/lerd
make install-installer  # installs lerd-installer to ~/.local/bin/
```

:::

The installer will:

- Check and offer to install missing prerequisites (Podman, NetworkManager, unzip)
- Download the latest `lerd` binary for your architecture (amd64 / arm64)
- Install it to `~/.local/bin/lerd`
- Add `~/.local/bin` to your shell's `PATH` (bash, zsh, or fish)
- Automatically run `lerd install` to complete environment setup

::: info DNS setup requires sudo
`lerd install` writes to `/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/` and `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/` and restarts NetworkManager. This is the only step that requires `sudo`.
:::

After install, reload your shell or open a new terminal so `PATH` takes effect.

`lerd install` will:

1. Create XDG config and data directories
2. Create the `lerd` Podman network
3. Download static binaries: Composer, fnm, mkcert
4. Install the mkcert CA into your system trust store
5. Write and start the `lerd-dns` and `lerd-nginx` Podman Quadlet containers
6. Enable the `lerd-watcher` background service (auto-discovers new projects)
7. Add `~/.local/share/lerd/bin` to your shell's `PATH`

---

### Install from a local build

If you built from source and want to skip the GitHub download:

```bash
make build
bash install.sh --local ./build/lerd
```

---

### Update

```bash
lerd update
```

Fetches the latest release from GitHub, downloads the binary for your architecture, and atomically replaces the running binary. No restart needed.

You can also re-run the installer:

::: code-group

```bash [curl]
curl -fsSL https://lerd.sh/install.sh | bash -s -- --update
```

```bash [wget]
wget -qO- https://lerd.sh/install.sh | bash -s -- --update
```

:::

---

### Uninstall

```bash
lerd uninstall
```

Stops all containers, disables and removes Quadlet units, removes the watcher service, removes the binary, tears down the `lerd` podman network (including aardvark-dns runtime state), and cleans up the `PATH` entry from your shell config.

Four opt-in prompts before finishing:

1. **Remove all config and data** — deletes `~/.config/lerd` and `~/.local/share/lerd` (takes your `sites.yaml`, bundled binaries, TLS certs, and all service data with it).
2. **Remove MCP integration** — unregisters lerd from Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Junie at user scope, removes `~/.claude/skills/lerd/`, `~/.cursor/rules/lerd.mdc`, and strips the lerd block from `~/.junie/guidelines.md`. Also runs across every registered site to clean the same files per-project.
3. **Uninstall mkcert CA** — runs `mkcert -uninstall` so browsers and OS trust stores stop trusting the lerd CA that `install` originally added.
4. **Purge lerd-built container images** — removes `lerd-php*-fpm:local`, `lerd-custom-*:local`, and `lerd-dnsmasq:local`. Upstream pulled images (mysql/redis/postgres/etc.) are deliberately left alone; they're expensive to re-pull and your database/app data lives in host bind mounts, not inside the images, so nothing is lost by keeping them.

To answer yes to every prompt without interaction:

```bash
lerd uninstall --force
```

---

### Check prerequisites only

```bash
bash install.sh --check
```

---

## macOS

### One-line installer (recommended)

::: code-group

```bash [curl]
curl -fsSL https://lerd.sh/install.sh | bash
```

```bash [wget]
wget -qO- https://lerd.sh/install.sh | bash
```

:::

The same installer powers Linux and macOS. On macOS it will:

- Check for the `podman` CLI and offer to `brew install podman` if it's missing
- Download the latest `darwin` binary for your architecture (amd64 / arm64)
- Install it to `~/.local/bin/lerd` and add that directory to your `PATH`
- Automatically run `lerd install`, which starts Podman Machine, mkcert, DNS, and nginx

::: info Homebrew is only used for Podman
The installer itself doesn't require Homebrew. It's used only to install the `podman` dependency when it isn't already present, so you can also install Podman by any other means beforehand.
:::

### Install via Homebrew (alternative)

```bash
brew install geodro/lerd/lerd
lerd install
```

Podman is installed automatically as a Homebrew dependency.

::: warning Untrusted tap
Recent Homebrew versions refuse to load formulae from third-party taps until they're trusted. If you see `Refusing to load formula ... from untrusted tap`, run `brew trust geodro/lerd` once, then retry.
:::

### Update

```bash
lerd update
```

If you installed via Homebrew instead, update with `brew upgrade lerd && lerd install`.

If you're running a local development build (a `git describe` version like `1.25.0-6-g7d03`), the one-line installer and `--update` detect it and ask before replacing it with a release binary, so an ahead-of-release build isn't overwritten silently. Decline to keep your build, or reinstall one explicitly with `install.sh --local <path>`.

### Uninstall

```bash
lerd uninstall                                    # tears down launchd agents, DNS resolver, containers
curl -fsSL https://lerd.sh/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

Run `lerd uninstall` first (while the binary is still present) so the DNS resolver and Podman state are cleaned up, then the installer's `--uninstall` removes the launchd agents and the binary. If you installed via Homebrew, finish with `brew uninstall lerd` instead of the second command. On macOS the installer detects when the binary is still present and pauses to remind you to run `lerd uninstall` first, since the DNS resolver (`/etc/resolver/test`, removed with sudo) and the Podman machine are unreachable once the binary is gone; if it can't reach a terminal it prints the manual removal commands at the end instead.

## Windows (beta)

There is no native Windows build. Lerd runs on Windows through WSL2, where the standard Linux build works unchanged once systemd and rootless Podman are set up. Windows support is **beta**, it works well for daily development but gets less testing than native Linux or macOS. See the [Windows (WSL2) guide](./wsl2) for the full walkthrough, including the `events_logger` Podman tweak and the mkcert root CA export to the Windows trust store.
