# Custom Containers

Lerd can serve sites that use their own container instead of the shared PHP-FPM image. This lets you run Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, or any other runtime alongside your PHP sites, with full access to services, HTTPS, LAN sharing, and workers.

## Quick start

1. Create a `Containerfile.lerd` in your project root:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
RUN npm install -g nodemon
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:dev"]
```

> The project directory is bind-mounted at runtime, so no `WORKDIR` or `COPY` is needed. Install any global CLI tools (nodemon, ts-node, etc.) in the image itself.

2. Run `lerd init`:

```bash
cd ~/projects/nestapp
lerd init
```

When no PHP project is detected and a `Containerfile.lerd` exists, the wizard switches to custom container mode and asks for the container port, containerfile path, HTTPS, and services. The answers are saved to `.lerd.yaml`.

Alternatively, write `.lerd.yaml` manually:

```yaml
domains:
  - nestapp
container:
  port: 3000
services:
  - mysql
  - redis
```

3. Link the site:

```bash
lerd link
```

Lerd builds the image, creates a dedicated container, and configures nginx to reverse-proxy to it.

> **Important:** `lerd link` must be called **after** both files exist. Calling it without the `container:` section in `.lerd.yaml` registers the project as a PHP-FPM site instead. If that happened, run `lerd unlink` first, then set up the files and link again. If you haven't written `.lerd.yaml` yet, run `lerd init` instead of writing it by hand, it detects the `Containerfile.lerd` and runs the custom container wizard for you.

## Configuration

The `container` section in `.lerd.yaml` accepts these fields:

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | yes | | Port the app listens on inside the container |
| `containerfile` | no | `Containerfile.lerd` | Path to the Containerfile (relative to project root) |
| `build_context` | no | `.` | Build context directory (relative to project root) |
| `target` | no | (last stage) | Stage to build in a multi-stage Containerfile, passed as `podman build --target`. Useful when your Containerfile has separate `development` and `production` stages and you want lerd to build the dev one locally. |
| `ssl` | no | `false` | Set to `true` if the app serves HTTPS on its port (nginx will `proxy_pass https://` with `proxy_ssl_verify off`) |

## How it works

When you `lerd link` a project with a `container` section:

1. The image is built from your Containerfile and tagged `lerd-custom-{sitename}:local`
2. A systemd quadlet is written so the container starts automatically
3. The container joins the `lerd` network (same as PHP-FPM and services)
4. Nginx is configured to `proxy_pass` to the container instead of `fastcgi_pass`
5. Your project directory is bind-mounted into the container

## Services

Services work exactly the same as for PHP sites. Containers on the `lerd` network can reach services by name:

- MySQL: `lerd-mysql:3306`
- Redis: `lerd-redis:6379`
- PostgreSQL: `lerd-postgres:5432`

## HTTPS

`lerd secure` and `lerd unsecure` work with custom container sites. The nginx vhost is regenerated with SSL termination, and your app continues to receive plain HTTP from nginx.

If your app itself serves HTTPS on its port (e.g. it has its own TLS cert), set `ssl: true` under `container:` so nginx proxies via HTTPS:

```yaml
container:
  port: 3000
  ssl: true
```

Nginx will use `proxy_pass https://` and skip certificate verification (`proxy_ssl_verify off`) since the container cert is self-signed. Run `lerd check` to confirm the setting is recognised.

## Hot reload

The project directory is bind-mounted into the container at the same absolute path, so file edits on the host are immediately visible inside the container. However, **filesystem watch events (inotify) do not fire** across the virtiofs mount boundary that Podman Machine uses on macOS. File watchers that rely on inotify (nodemon's default, Vite, webpack, etc.) will not detect changes.

Use polling instead:

| Tool | Polling flag |
|------|-------------|
| nodemon | `--legacy-watch` |
| Vite | `--watch` (already polls) or set `server.watch.usePolling: true` in `vite.config` |
| NestJS | `nest start --watch` uses nodemon, add `--legacy-watch` via `nodemon.json`: `{"legacyWatch": true}` |
| webpack | `watchOptions: { poll: 1000 }` in webpack config |

Example `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start:dev": "nodemon --legacy-watch src/main.js"
  }
}
```

The polling interval is typically 1–2 seconds, which is fine for dev.

## Workers

Define workers in `.lerd.yaml` using `custom_workers`:

```yaml
container:
  port: 3000
custom_workers:
  dev-server:
    label: Dev Server
    command: npm run start:dev
    restart: always
  queue:
    label: Queue Worker
    command: node dist/queue.js
    restart: on-failure
```

Workers exec into the custom container, so they have access to the same filesystem and environment.

Worker config fields:

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `label` | no | worker name | Display name in the dashboard |
| `command` | yes | | Shell command to run inside the container |
| `restart` | no | `always` | `always` or `on-failure` |
| `schedule` | no | | systemd OnCalendar expression for timer-based workers |
| `conflicts_with` | no | | Worker names to stop before starting this one |

Worker definitions stay in `custom_workers` permanently. The `workers` list tracks which are active and is synced by start/stop commands.

## LAN sharing

LAN sharing works transparently since it proxies through nginx.

## Pausing

`lerd pause` stops the custom container and all workers, replacing the nginx vhost with a landing page. `lerd unpause` starts the container back up and restores workers.

## Restarting

`lerd restart` restarts the custom container without rebuilding the image. Useful after config changes inside the container.

## Unlinking

`lerd unlink` stops the custom container, removes the quadlet, and cleans up the image.

## Rebuilding

`lerd rebuild` removes the old image, rebuilds from the Containerfile, and restarts the container:

```bash
lerd rebuild
```

`lerd link` reuses the cached image if it already exists. Use `lerd rebuild` when you change the Containerfile.

## CLI commands

| Command | Description |

| `lerd link` | Build image, create container, generate nginx vhost |
| `lerd unlink` | Stop container, remove image, quadlet, and vhost |
| `lerd secure` / `lerd unsecure` | Toggle HTTPS |
| `lerd pause` / `lerd unpause` | Pause/resume the site and container |
| `lerd restart` | Restart the container |
| `lerd rebuild` | Rebuild image from Containerfile and restart |
| `lerd worker start <name>` | Start a custom worker |
| `lerd worker stop <name>` | Stop a custom worker |
| `lerd worker list` | List available workers and status |
