// filterConflictingDomains splits desired into the domains that ownPath is
// allowed to claim and those already taken by a different site. The check is
// strict: a domain is a conflict regardless of TLS scheme (HTTPS vs HTTP).
// Two sites cannot share the same domain even on different ports — DNS and
// browser caches don't disambiguate by scheme reliably. Order is preserved
// so the user's preferred primary domain stays primary if it survives.
//
// Re-linking the same path is not a conflict — domains owned by ownPath stay
// in the kept list. Reserved domains (e.g. lerd's own internal hosts) are
// always filtered out.
